# OroDPDBundle

OroDPDBundle adds the [DPD](https://www.dpd.com/) shipping service [integration](https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/IntegrationBundle) to Oro applications and helps admin users to enable and configure DPD [shipping methods](https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ShippingBundle) for invoices, quotes, and customer orders.

The bundle also adds the [operation](https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ActionBundle) button for admin users to the order view pages to provide order shipping data and send the package pick-up request to the DPD service.

For more information, please see online DPD [user](https://doc.oroinc.com/user/back-office/system/integrations/shipping-integration/dpd) and [bundle](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/extensions/DPDBundle/) documentation.
